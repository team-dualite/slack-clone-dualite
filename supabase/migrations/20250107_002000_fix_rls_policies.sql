# Fix RLS Policy Infinite Recursion

This migration fixes the infinite recursion issue in Row Level Security policies
by restructuring how channel access is determined to avoid circular references.

## Query Description: 
This operation fixes database security policies that were causing infinite recursion errors.
The changes ensure proper access control without circular dependencies. This is a safe
operation that improves security without affecting existing data.

## Metadata:
- Schema-Category: "Safe"
- Impact-Level: "Low"
- Requires-Backup: false
- Reversible: true

## Structure Details:
- Fixes RLS policies on channel_members, channels, and messages tables
- Removes circular policy references
- Implements proper security hierarchy

## Security Implications:
- RLS Status: Enabled (improved)
- Policy Changes: Yes (fixed)
- Auth Requirements: Users can only access their own data and public channels

## Performance Impact:
- Indexes: No changes
- Triggers: No changes
- Estimated Impact: Improved performance due to elimination of recursive checks
